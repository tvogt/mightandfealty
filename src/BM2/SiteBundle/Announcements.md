### New Message System Experiment ###
You will find a third column under "messages" that leads to a new, experimental message system as discussed on the forum.
This is *for testing only* and will be shut down again after a few days. But please play with it and give feedback.


### Recent Changes ###
* The saddler and bowyer now provide a bonus to food production.
* The fairground and merchant's quarter now produce tiny amounts of metal. This may not work, please report on the forums if it does not.
* The Merchant's Quarter now provides a bonus to food production, this was missing.
* Evasion chances have been reduced. The base chance has been lowered from 60% to 40% and the high cap was lowered from 90% to 80%.


### New / Experimental Features ###
* Knight offers can now contain lordship of the settlement. Use with care.
* Experimental preview version of war declarations has gone live for testing. Find it under Politics.
* Artifacts have gone live - create unique items with their own history. Limited to paying accounts and one per account, so yes, artifacts will be really rare.
* Some progress on local quests, try it out, even if it's not complete, yet.
