  description:  See your oaths in a graphical view.
  longdesc:     View the tree of oaths that you belong to. (might take a short while to generate for large trees)
 name:          Oath of Fealty
 intro: >
   Fealty is what defines the hierarchy and political system. What exactly an oath contains - vassalage, military service, 
   shares of estate income, protection, honour and politics - is negotiable between liege and vassal.<br />
   Here you can swear an oath of fealty to a nearby character, which turns you into his or her vassal. This will also make
   your estate a part of his/her realm.
 hasvassals: >
   All your vassals will also become a part of the realm you join, as their oath to you binds them to your decisions. Of course,
   if you act against their will, they might leave you afterwards.
 isruler: >
   This action will mean the end of your realm as an independent entity.
 hasliege: >
   Your current oath will automatically be dissolved and your current liege, %liege%, will be notified.
 current:   current oath
 swear:     swear a new oath
 swearintro: Since a lord can hold estates in or be ruler of different realms, some lords may appear multiple times with different realms, and you get to choose which of their realms to join.
 nobody:    There are no eligible new lords within your action range.
 newliege:	new liege
 choose:		-- choose liege --
 norealm:   independent
 swearto:   swear oath to...
 submit:		swear oath
 fail:
  vassal:	You cannot swear an oath to your own vassals (or their vassals).

 unavailable: Nobles unavailable as lords
 reason:
  liege:   already is your current liege
  vassal:  is your vassal or a vassal of one of your vassals

  title:        Disown Vassal
  desc: >
    If %name% has been disloyal to you, broken the oaths of fealty or otherwise justified this serious action,
    you can dissolve the fealty relationship below.<br />
    This is a serious action and will be marked in your vassals history. You should also use the opportunity 
    to visit the character page - %name% and leave a reputation comment.
  submit:       disown
  success: >
    %name% is no longer your vassal.<br />
    You should also visit the character page and leave a reputation comment to indicate what caused you to
    take this drastic action.

rogue:
 name:        Go Rogue
 description: Declare independence.
 longdesc:    You can also break your oath without swearing a new one, becoming an independent lord or knight.
 intro: >
   You can break your oath of fealty at any time, declaring yourself independent, a rogue noble without realm or lord.<br />
   This step is not to be taken lightly, as other nobles can and will hunt you and your vassals for fame and fortune. Having no lord also
   means having no protection, both militarily and politically. Make sure you know what you are doing.
 submit:      become a rogue noble
 success:     You are now an independent noble, or a rogue as your fellow nobles will consider you to be.

successor:
 name:      your successor
 you:       you are successor to
 intro: >
   Death being a part of life, it is important for every noble to assign a successor to his or her titles and holdings.<br />
   You can select any character nearby enough to exchange documents, or anyone of your characters (as they are assumed to be
   from the same family or dynasty) irrespective of distance. Note that your estates, titles, etc. will leave your control 
   if they are inherited by a character that does not belong to you.
 set:       assign a new successor
 choose:    -- choose successor --
 submit:    set successor

  intro: >
    With sufficient power and no one above you, it might be time to step unto the stage of world politics. You can
    announce the lands under your control as a <i>realm</i>, which is a generic term for anything from a barony to
    an empire.<br />
    In fact, it is entirely up to you what to call your new realm. The only thing stopping you from calling three
    villages an empire is the ridicule of your peers. The proper mixture of ambition and modesty might be advisable.<br />
    You can change the designation of your realm later on.<br />
  choose:     -- choose --
  submit:     announce new realm
 manage:
  name:         Manage Realm
  description:  Change realm name, color and other details.
  longdesc:     As you are the ruler of %formalname%, you have complete executive control over your realm. Whether or not your vassals will stand for it if you exert it too freely, however, is a different question.
  intro: >
    As the ruler of %name%, you can change the realm's details at any time. Please note that realistically, these
    details almost never change, so make sure you have a good reason.<br />
    The designation of your realm must always stay above that of all inferior realms, limiting your choices.
  submit:       announce changes
  success:      Realm details have been updated.

  name:         Abdicate
  description:  Renounce rulership and hand it to someone else.

war:
 name:          Declare War
 description:   Create an official declaration of war.
 longdesc:      More than a noble gesture, a declaration of war is how a realm formally attacks another, with a given purpose. Also, the only way to gain respect and glory in warfare.

    While %realm% is a part of %parent% at this time, you can change its allegiance at any time. What your fellow
    nobles think of you if you do this constantly, on the other hand...<br />
    In order to change, a member of your new superior realm must be nearby. Also note that you can only join realms with
    a higher designation then your own realm has, so a kingdom, for example, cannot become a part of a barony.

 join:
  name:         Join Realm
  description: >
    Submitting to another realm integrates your realm into their hierarchy, making it a part of the other realm.
    While this means giving up on sovereignty, it makes you and your vassals a part of something bigger and
    possibly more powerful.<br />
    Your submission can be handed to any member of the new superior realm.<br />
    Also note that you can only join realms with a higher designation than your own realm has, so a kingdom,
    for example, cannot become a part of a barony.

  intro: >
    While %realm% is a part of %parent% at this time, you can always declare that relation null and void and make
    %realm% an independent %type%.<br />
    Of course, you should make sure you are willing to handle the possible repercussions of this step.

    always has to remain in the settlement.
  construct: >
    Allows others to initiate and manage construction projects in your settlement.<br />
    To prevent excessive building, you can define a <em>reserve</em> value, which is the percentage of peasants that must remain
    in the workforce.
  recruit: >
    Allows others to train new soldiers in your settlement.<br />
    To prevent excessive recruitment, you can set the <em>amount</em> value, which limits the number of new soldiers sent into
    training per day. This value is shared by everyone on the list. 
  trade: >
    Allows others to initiate trades from your settlement towards others, i.e. outbound trade.<br />
    Be very careful with this option as it cannot be limited, and someone trading all your food away can very quickly bring ruin
    to your settlement. Only grant this to the most trusted people.
  docks: >
    Allow the use of the docks (if you have them) to embark on sea journeys.
  positions: >
    Allows the management of non-rulership positions and their permissions within the realm. This is a very powerful position as the
    ability to grant or remove positions puts the holder above everyone, except the ruler(s).
  expel: >
    Expelling estates from the realm will remove them from the realm hierarchy, together with their lords and knights, provided
    these are not linked to the realm through a different estate as well (i.e. to remove a person from the realm, make sure you
    expel all estates they are lord or knight of, in all sub-realms).
  diplomacy: >
    Allows the negotiation and signing of treaties with other realms.
  laws: >
    Grants editorial access to the realms laws and regulations publication.
